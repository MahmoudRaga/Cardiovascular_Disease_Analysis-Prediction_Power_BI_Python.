🩺 Cardiovascular Disease Analysis & Prediction – Power BI & Python
📌 Overview
This project provides an in-depth data analysis and visualization of cardiovascular patients using Power BI and Python. The dataset contains detailed clinical and laboratory information about patients, including their health history, risk factors, and diagnostic results.

The project not only includes comprehensive dashboards and reports, but also integrates a machine learning model for predictive analysis and supports academic research contributions.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze patterns of chronic diseases (like Diabetes, Hypertension, CAD).

Visualize distributions of clinical indicators and test results.

Predict the likelihood of having CAD using Machine Learning.

Provide dynamic and interactive dashboards for medical insights.

Support research through data-driven contributions and advanced feature engineering.

🧠 Technologies Used
Power BI – Dashboarding, data modeling, KPI tracking, and visual storytelling.

Python – Data preprocessing, feature transformation, and Machine Learning.

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn – For ML and data wrangling.

DAX & M Language – For calculations, transformations, and KPIs inside Power BI.

📊 Dashboard Pages
1️⃣ General Overview
Total patients, gender distribution, average age, weight, and blood pressure.

Donut charts to show disease status (e.g. Has CAD vs No CAD).

KPIs for chronic disease prevalence.

2️⃣ Disease Breakdown
Bar charts for each chronic disease (DM, HTN, DLP, etc).

Distribution by gender, function class, and disease status.

KPIs to track patient counts per condition.

3️⃣ Demographics & Lifestyle
Pie charts for smoking status (Current, Former, Non-Smoker).

Donut for function class & thyroid disease.

Age & weight distribution.

Gender ratio visualization.

4️⃣ Detailed Patient Table
Matrix showing all patient data.

Includes test results (HB, HDL, LDL, TG, ESR, etc), disease history, function class, and RWMA.

Allows filtered analysis by patient or condition.

🤖 Machine Learning Component
A supervised machine learning model (Logistic Regression / Random Forest) was developed using the cleaned and transformed data to predict Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). The model was trained and evaluated using:

Feature engineering (lab values, chronic conditions, symptoms)

Data balancing and scaling

Model performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC)

🎓 Research Contribution
This project played a key role in supporting an academic research paper by providing:

High-quality data wrangling and transformation.

In-depth domain analysis.

Predictive modeling and visual insight.

Significant enhancements to the original dataset, including advanced feature labeling and visualization techniques.
